# EventManagment
I code with visual studio which already has a c++ compiler built in so all i have to do to get it to run is press run. 
When you do run it create an event first. DO NOT EXIT THE PROGRAM. then click 2 to see the event you just created. input 3 to save the event you have created to the file.
