I attempted to just work with one class. starting with the Concert Class. 
I created my setters and getters to hold input information and created vectors to store information. 
Then i worked with the main in Event System Management.cpp trying to get the main to pull methods from the concert.cpp class. 
My approach was to get an event created and saved but i ran into file issues and figured i was off track completely. 
So the next approach was to break everything down into smaller pieces and attempt to work with the factory and strategy methods but  i ran into issues with access and i wasn't even sure what it all meant or where my memory was going with these strategies.
